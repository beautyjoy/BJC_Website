      This Snap*!* project has all the reference sheet commands implemented in Snap*!*, with Robot commands, the ability to import/export mazes from/to a text file, and the ability to click directly on the maze to edit it (clicking on any cell will toggle it from blank->goal->wall->blank->etc.). You can move the Robot around with the left/up/right arrow keys and query CAN_MOVE with the down arrow key. We have two "assignment" (i.e., left arrow) blocks, one solid and one hollow: the solid one is for defining and assigning a new variable, and the hollow one is for updating the assignment (you drag the variable you want to assign into the left slot).

      Finally, we've taken the five programming activities from the CED (course and exam description) purple book and shown how those are translated into these blocks (at the bottom).

      Email any problems to Dan (ddgarcia@cs.berkeley.edu).
