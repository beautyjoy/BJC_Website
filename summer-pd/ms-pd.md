BJC has hosted summer PD workshops for almost a decade, traditionally geared toward our high school and undergraduate level curriculum. But this time, we are excited to announce our inaugural BJC PD workshop specifically for our newly developed middle school curricum. It has been a long time goal to expand our reach beyond the high school setting, to bring exciting and engaging CS curriculum further into the K-12 ecosystem. We are super excited that we are finally in a place to do just that, and we hope you are able to join us this summer!

### Middle School PD Details for Summer 2021

BJC will offer a one week (5 days) virtual computer science PD workshop this summer 2021 with generous support from the Hopper Dean Foundation. This opportunity is primarily for middle school teachers and administrators, but we also welcome participation from parents or community members running extra curricular activities for their middle school students. No prior experience with computer science is necessary. We are looking to have a cohort of at least 20 teachers.

There will be 4 hours of synchronous activities per day, with the remainder of the time daily for asynchronous work, to offer schedule flexibility to participants. The BJC middle school curriculum consists of 3 units, with the first two units designed to last for one full academic year. This workshop will focus on the first 2 units, and will provide a preview of the third unit. All course materials will be available online at no cost (link to the curriculum coming soon!).

This workshop will be led by Dan Garcia, Teaching Professor at the University of California, Berkeley. The curriculum and workshop is supported by a small team of BJC veterans -- Mary Fries, Lauren Mock, Talia Ye, and BJC TAs and Master Teachers.

## How to Apply

We will be releasing a link to the PD application shortly! We will be accepting applications on a rolling basis up to summer.
